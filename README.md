# Advent of Code

This repo contains an aggregation of multiple years of [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding puzzles.

I tend to use these puzzles for exploring new languages, libraries, and tools
while completing a novel set of puzzles.

Each year's puzzles is organized into a new top level folder. Each year tends to
use its own language and tools for managing and running the puzzles. The appoach
used for each year is generally documented in the yearly directories. Due to the
way I explore (sometimes very novel and unstable) tools there is no guarantee
that solutions from old years will still remain runnable using modern versions
of the toolchains.
